DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
Enable users to create and manage their own 'groups'. Each group can have subscribers, and maintains a
group page where subscribers can post into. Membership to groups may be open, moderated, or invitation only.

Support for group photo albums is available. Groups may choose their own theme. Groups have RSS feeds,
and so on.

INSTALLATION
---------------
- Activate the module as usual
- Visit the admin/settings/og page and click the button to enable access control.
- Set other preferences on admin/settings/og as desired.
- On the admin/settings/content-types page, disable commenting and attachments for nodes of type 'group'
- On the admin/block page, enable the 'Group details' with a low 'weight' value. Optionally enable the 'Group subscribers', 'New groups, 'My groups' blocks.
- Grant permissions as needed on the admin/access page
- Begin creating groups, subscribing to those groups, and posting into those groups. The subscribe link appears in the Group block, for non invite-only groups.

NOTES
----------------
- Drupal has poor support for running more than one node_access type module at one. That means that you can't run og with
taxonomy_access, nodeperm_by_role, nodeaccess, or any other node access control module. This is a core Drupal issue, not an og issue. Developers - feel free
to propose a solution for this. See http://drupal.org/node/23193
- 'Administer nodes' permission is required for changing the Manager of a group
- 'Administer nodes' permission enables viewing of all nodes regardless of private/public status
- All subscriber management happens on the 'subscriber list' page which is linked from the group Block (while viewing a group page). This includes approving subscription requests (for selective groups), subscribing/unsubscribing users and promoting users into group admins.
- If you decide to stop using this module, click the 'disable' button on the admin/settings/og page. If you ever decide to re-enable, all your prior subscriptions and group settings are preserved.


THEMES
------------------
You may wish to stylize nodes which have properties assigned by this module.
--- public vs. private posts are denoted by $node->og_public
--- group assignments (if any) are to be found in $node->og_groups. this is an array of nids. the group names are in $node->og_groups_names.
--- you may wish to omit the node author and time if $node->type == 'og'. also consider not showing node links for these nodes since they slightly clutter the group home page.
--- provided in this package are two template files for the phptemplate engine. One stylizes group nodes and suggested above and the other stylizes all other nodes as suggested above. These can be starting points for your customization of look and feel of the central area of the group home page.
